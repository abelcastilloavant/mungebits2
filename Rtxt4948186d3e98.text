     Constructing mungepieces and mungebits by hand is a little
     tedious. To simplify the process, we introduce a tiny DSL that
     allows for easier construction of mungebits. The intention is for
     this function to be used in conjuction with a list passed to the
     ‘munge’ helper.

    args: list. A list of arguments. This can be of the formats

           1. ‘list(train_fn, ...)’ If ‘args’ is a function followed by
              other arguments, the constructed mungepiece will use the
              ‘train_fn’ as both the _train and predict_ function for
              the mungebit, and ‘list(...)’ (that is, the remaining
              elements in the list) will be used as both the train and
              predict arguments in the mungepiece.

          ‘list(train_fn, ...)’, ‘list(list(train_fn, predict_fn),
          ...)’, and ‘list(list(train_fn, ...), list(predict_fn,
          ...))’. In the first example, the train and predict function
          are assumed to be identical. In the first two examples, the
          arguments to these functions are assumed to be identical (for
          example, if the same kind of filter needs to be applied to a
          data set that is about to be trained as to one about to be
          predicted). Finally, the last example is the most flexible
          and allows different parameters for the training and
          prediction function, respectively. The given training and
          prediction functions are used to construct a ‘mungebit’, and
          the resulting ‘mungebit’ and the remaining arguments are
          stored in a ‘mungepiece’.
